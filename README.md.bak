# A sneak peek into the Airbnb activity in Seattle

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) containing approximately 3800 listings to better understand:
 - What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
 - How did this trend correlate to booking price?
 - Is there anything else that also affects the booking price?

This is an opportunity for me to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium which hopefully will give the reader insight into these questions. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to present my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells and comment were used throughout to explain the process taken.
A folder contains 3 files of dataset is also attached in case you want to see the data.

## Summary of the results
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@ngdung28996/a-sneak-peek-into-the-airbnb-activity-in-seattle-bce201672776)
